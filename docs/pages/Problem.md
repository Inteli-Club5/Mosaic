# 2. Problem

The AI creator economy is fundamentally broken. While artificial intelligence capabilities have exploded in recent years, the infrastructure for connecting AI specialists with those who need their expertise remains stuck in the dark ages.

### The Creator Monetization Crisis

Today's AI creators face a harsh reality: despite possessing valuable expertise, they struggle to build sustainable businesses. Traditional platforms like OpenAI's GPT Store or Hugging Face offer minimal monetization options, while consulting marketplaces take 20-50% commission fees. A data scientist who builds a specialized model for financial analysis might spend months perfecting it, only to find no viable path to recurring revenue.

Consider Sarah Chen, a machine learning engineer who created a sophisticated marketing analytics agent. On existing platforms, she faces three equally unsatisfying options: sell it as a one-time software license (limiting ongoing revenue), join a consulting platform that takes 40% of her earnings, or try to market it independently without any discovery mechanism.

### The User Access Problem

From the user perspective, finding the right AI expertise is like navigating a maze blindfolded. Small businesses need specialized help with everything from inventory optimization to customer service automation, but accessing these capabilities requires either:

1. **Expensive consulting engagements** - Often $10,000+ minimums that price out smaller companies
2. **Generic SaaS subscriptions** - Monthly fees for broad tools that may not fit specific needs  
3. **Building in-house teams** - Requiring significant hiring and infrastructure investments

A restaurant owner needing help with demand forecasting shouldn't have to choose between a $50,000 consulting contract and a generic analytics tool that doesn't understand their industry.

### The Trust and Verification Gap

Perhaps most critically, current AI services operate in black boxes. Users have no way to verify the quality, reliability, or even authenticity of AI agents before purchasing. There's no transparent track record, no verifiable usage statistics, and no guarantee that the agent will remain available after purchase.

This lack of transparency creates a vicious cycle: creators can't build reputation, users can't make informed decisions, and the entire ecosystem remains fragmented and inefficient.

### Technical Infrastructure Limitations

Existing platforms also suffer from significant technical constraints:

- **Centralized control** means platforms can arbitrarily remove creators or change terms
- **Limited access models** force users into all-or-nothing subscription patterns
- **No ownership rights** leave both creators and users vulnerable to platform changes
- **Expensive transactions** make micro-payments for small tasks economically unfeasible

The result is a market where billions of dollars in potential value remains trapped because the infrastructure to unlock it simply doesn't exist.
