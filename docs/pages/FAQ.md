# 10. FAQ

## 10.1 How does Mosaic differ from other AI platforms?

**Q: What makes Mosaic unique compared to ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI services?**

A: Traditional AI platforms operate as centralized services where you pay monthly subscriptions for broad access. Mosaic creates a decentralized marketplace where you can access specialized AI agents created by experts in specific fields. Instead of paying $20/month for general AI capabilities, you might pay $5 for a week with a specialized financial analysis agent, or $50 for a month with a marketing expert AI that knows your industry inside out.

The key difference is ownership and specialization. On Mosaic, creators maintain full ownership of their AI agents and keep 85% of revenue, while users get access to highly specialized expertise at flexible pricing.

## 10.2 How do NFT access tokens work?

**Q: I'm new to NFTs. How do these "access tokens" actually work?**

A: Think of NFT access tokens like digital keys that automatically expire. When you purchase access to an AI agent, you receive an NFT in your wallet that grants you unlimited conversations with that agent for a specific time period (like 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days).

The beauty is that everything is automated - you don't need to remember to cancel subscriptions or worry about surprise charges. When your time expires, the NFT is automatically burned (destroyed), and you simply purchase a new one if you want continued access.

## 10.3 How do I know if an AI agent is legitimate?

**Q: How can I verify that an AI agent is high-quality and not a scam?**

A: We have several verification systems:

- **Creator verification**: All creators undergo identity verification
- **Performance metrics**: Public ratings, response times, and success rates
- **Community reviews**: Detailed reviews from real users
- **Trial periods**: Many agents offer free trials or money-back guarantees
- **Expertise badges**: Verified credentials and specializations

Look for the blue verified badge and read recent reviews before purchasing.
