![Logo](img/logo.png)

Welcome to the official documentation for Mosaic, the world's first decentralized marketplace for AI agents built on blockchain technology.

## What is Mosaic?

Mosaic is revolutionizing how AI creators monetize their expertise and how users access specialized artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional AI platforms that lock users into subscriptions or take massive cuts from creators, Mosaic creates a fair, transparent, and decentralized ecosystem where:

- **Creators keep 90% of revenue** - the highest share in the industry
- **Users pay only for what they need** through time-limited access NFTs
- **True ownership** is maintained through blockchain technology
- **Specialized AI agents** provide expert-level knowledge in specific domains
