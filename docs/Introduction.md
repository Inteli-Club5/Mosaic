# 1. Introduction

The artificial intelligence landscape is rapidly evolving, but accessing specialized AI expertise remains fragmented and expensive. Most AI services operate in silos, with creators struggling to monetize their work fairly while users face high costs and limited options.

Mosaic addresses this fundamental disconnect by creating the first decentralized marketplace where AI agents become tradeable assets. Think of it as combining the accessibility of app stores with the ownership guarantees of blockchain technology.

Unlike traditional AI platforms that lock users into subscriptions or take massive cuts from creators, Mosaic uses NFT-based access tokens that provide time-limited usage rights. Users purchase exactly what they need, while creators maintain true ownership of their intellectual property and keep 90% of earnings - the highest revenue share in the industry.

The platform leverages Hedera Hashgraph for fast, low-cost transactions and Walrus for decentralized storage, ensuring that neither users nor creators depend on centralized gatekeepers. This infrastructure enables everything from micro-transactions for quick consultations to enterprise licensing deals worth thousands of dollars.
